Main Objectives:
 - Repurpose old 3D printer parts into a functional 4 axis robot arm.
 - Design and 3D print all parts for the robot arm.
 - Create a set of gear ratio'd axis in order to maximise torque and therefore load that the arm can carry.
 - Convert G-Code driven software, from GBRL, into a 3 plan cartesian work space.
 - Automate 3 sequences for the arm to perform, by moving from point A - B in the 3 plan space.
