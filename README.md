# Project Tony Stark
A repository of all my resources and details for the first iteration of the robot arm I am creating


Main Objectives:

- Repurpose old 3D printer parts into a functional 4 axis robot arm.
- Design and 3D print all parts for the robot arm.
- Create a set of gear ratio'd axis in order to maximise torque and therefore load that the arm can carry.
- Convert G-Code driven software, from GBRL, into a 3 plan cartesian work space.
- Automate 3 sequences for the arm to perform, by moving from point A - B in the 3 plan space.



Part List:
 - 4 stepper motors
 - Arduino Uno micro controller
 - CNC Shield V3 - Open source stepper motor driver
 - Limit switches repurposed from 3D printer
