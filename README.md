# Project Tony Stark
A repository of all my resources and details for the first iteration of the robot arm I am creating


Main Objectives:

- Repurpose old 3D printer parts into a functional 4 axis robot arm.
- Design and 3D print all parts for the robot arm.
- Create a set of gear ratio'd axis in order to maximise torque and therefore load that the arm can carry.
- Automate 3 sequences for the arm to perform, by moving from point A - B in a 3-plane space.
- Create a set of motions that the arm can operate by providing it with a code for each sequence, therefore allowing for quicker programming. 


Part List:
 - 4 NEMA-17 look-alike stepper motors
 - Arduino Uno micro controller
 - CNC Shield V3 - Open source stepper motor driver
 - Limit switches repurposed from 3D printer



To-Do:
- Assess torque capabilities of motors.
- 3D print prototype of planetary gearbox.
