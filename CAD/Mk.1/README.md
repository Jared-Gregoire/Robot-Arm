Mk.1 design of 3D printed frame for the arm. 
- This design has not been modelled in regard to load it could carry or manufacturing time/costs. This has led to it being far to large for my 3D printer to print correctly and more costly for a prototype then I would like.
- While not feasible to manufacture for me, this model has helped develop my thought process on robot arm design.
- I am very happy with my design for the wrist joint, I believe the concept for it is sound, although the execution may require a gear ratio in order to take more load.

Key Knowledge gained:
- Belt drive is not needed, further gear ratio should be explored as it allows for lighter and simpler design while providing less complications in assembly.
- Weight of the arm needs to be removed. To maintin rigidity I think thinner plastic structures can be used and reinforced with thin metal poles if needed.
- Wrist socket can be used and explored in design.
- Connection to base is sound with bearings used to allow low friction rotation on the load-bearing bottom joint.
